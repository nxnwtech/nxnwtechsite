    <h1>North by Northwest (nxnwtech) Tech meetup is a meetup aimed at connecting the NxNW's technology community, the people who are making the North West and the surrounding area's tech scene what it is and those who are interested in keeping up-to-date. We run both in person 'nxnwtech M' and virtual 'nxnwtech V' meetups. Talks are technology focused. If you're a technology professional or enthusiast, and live in or around the NxNW area, we want you to join our meetup. You can also follow and contact us via @nxnwtech on twitter and by following #nxnwtech hashtag.</h1>
